# üé¨ Netflix Content Classification & Recommendation System

An **AI-powered system** that classifies Netflix titles (Movie vs. TV Show) and recommends similar content using both **TF-IDF** and **Transformer-based semantic models**.  
Built with **Python, scikit-learn, Sentence Transformers, and Gradio** for an interactive UI.

## üìå Project Overview
OTT platforms like Netflix have thousands of titles, making it challenging for users to discover relevant content.  
This project aims to:
- Automatically **classify Netflix titles** as *Movie* or *TV Show* using ML models.
- Provide **intelligent recommendations** using both keyword-based and semantic similarity.
- Deliver an **interactive UI** for end users and stakeholders.
